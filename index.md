# My Cyber-Mental Space

I suspect that this will be a mess of half constructs rather than anything remotely
coherent or helpful. That said, here's the list of ideas I have for what I would one
day like to have

- About me
- Blog
- Publications
- Projects

To expand each of those to an actionable description:

### About Me

Just the write up you would expect. A photo or two, links to socials, and as much
self obsessed nonsense that I can fit. A resume and CV probably wouldn't go amiss
as well. Honestly, it's the easiest part and I really should just get it over with.
I'll see what I can do.

### Blog

A public journal I guess. Will be an excuse to do some monthly(?) writing and,
arguably more importantly, review practice. I suspect posts will be on whatever
I found interesting in my work that month, with maybe the post or two about something
outside of STEM.

### Publications

If/When some of my stuff gets published, I'll link it here for easy documentation.
The writing will be substantially more polished, and proportionally less frequent.
I may supplement this with unpublished formal written work (think Paul's notes at an
undergraduate level but drastically less helpful).

### Projects

Things that I do that are not all in my head. Probably primarily code and some writing,
but the things that people can pick up and start playing with themselves should they
so desire. A key point is that everything here will be extensible by design: source
code available, sheet music available, and generally the guts will be exposed with the idea
being that anyone could pick up and play.
